              "\"As we entered the new millennium, banking and financial services often were highlighted as models \\nfor transforming healthcare. These models have continued to evolve and offer insights for \\nconsumer -centered healthcare services. As the automatic teller machi ne has transformed retail \\nbanking, the personal health record (PHR) will be used to build new relationships and new structures \\nthat support consumers. For individuals working to improve their health and manage their care, \\nPHRs will reach across time and in to every setting, from their homes and offices, to their physicians’ \\noffice and the hospital. More than seven in ten Americans (72 percent) are eager for the new \\nfunctionalities PHRs offer.1 Much of the early work on PHRs has been done by the Markle \\nFounda tion, which funds and directs the collaborative known as Connecting for Health and the \\nPersonal Health Technology Initiative. According to Zoë Baird, president of the Markle Foundation, \\n“Americans use digital  \\ninformation technology to manage their financ es, pay bills, book flights, and customize the music \\nthey listen to, and…they now want to use health information technology to get the best care \\npossible for themselves and be better able to manage their own health…. People realize that if they \\nor those th ey love are in an accident or disaster, having their medical records available at a \\nmoment’s notice through secure electronic information exchange could mean the difference \\nbetween life and death.”2 At the same time, the California HealthCare Foundation, a n independent \\nphilanthropy, reports that nearly three out of four Americans express significant concerns about the \\nprivacy and confidentiality of their personal health information.3 Clearly, failing to address privacy \\nissues could have major implications f or PHRs and efforts to transform healthcare nationwide. Yet 59 \\npercent of those respondents stated they would be willing to share their personal health \\ninformation when it could result in better medical treatment.4  \\nTransformation of any sector requires i nvestment, but can yield benefits. The ATMs transformed \\nhow consumers bank and interact with banks. Retail Banking Research Ltd. put the cost at more than \\n$40 billion to purchase the machines and many times that amount to maintain them.5 To maximize \\nthis i nvestment, the banking industry is creating new services that enable consumers to pay traffic \\ntickets and child support via ATM and employers to issue “plastic paychecks.”6 Originally developed \\nto give consumers access to cash, the ATM has become the leadi ng edge of a movement toward \\nonline banking and away from paper checks and paper money. The emergence of interoperable \\nelectronic medical records across the country stands to build on this readiness and transform \\nhealthcare, at not inconsiderable costs. Ac cording to estimates from the RAND Health Information \\nTechnology Project, the cost of adoption for the next 15 years totals an average of $6.5 billion per \\nyear for hospitals and $1.1 billion for physician offices, while combined potential savings reach $14 2 \\nbillion to $371 billion, or $9.5 billion to $24.7 billion annually.7 That said, the study authors note that \\n“providers must absorb the costs of EMR systems, but consumers and payers are the most likely to \\nreap the savings” and suggest that “the efficienc ies will be used to improve quality rather than to \\nreduce costs.”8 Even so, decisions in healthcare are rarely made according to bottom -line economics \\nalone. James Walker, chief medical information officer at Geisinger Health System, observed that, \\n“We hav e enough estimates. To enable providers and payers to make serious commitments to \\nimplementing EMRs, we need real -world demonstrations of how commercially available EMRs can \\nsupport improved care processes cost -effectively.”9 Moreover, policymakers need to  provide \\nincentives and support services, especially for solo and small group practices, “where more than \\ntwothirds of U.S. physicians work.”10 Healthcare consumers “want their experiences to mirror their \\nexpectations as consumers in other areas of their l ife,” and they want “more involvement in deciding \\nwhat healthcare they want to receive and how they want it delivered.”11 As a panel of U.S. business \\nleaders concluded, consumers “are ready for change as they increasingly seek more healthcare \\ninformation a nd choices….and would be the ultimate beneficiaries of health information technology and the resultant transformation of America’s healthcare system, as they have been for previous \\ntechnological revolutions.”12 In 2004, one in three U.S. residents, or eigh t in 10 Internet users, went \\nonline to find information about a medical problem.13 In 2005, nine out of 10 who went online for \\nhealth information confirmed that they had successful searches and found reliable information.14 \\nThey reported finding answers to  health -related questions such as diet and fitness (51 percent and \\n42 percent).15 Consumers also made growing use of self -management tools, from home surveillance \\nsystems to decision support aids, to “manage their health issues outside formal medical \\ninsti tutions.”16 Clearly, consumers in what has been called the “iPod generation” are receptive to \\nusing “digital tools,”17 with revenues for home and portable peripherals expected to reach more \\nthan $2.5 billion in 2005 and annual sales expected to grow at a r ate of 8.5 percent.18 In 2005, \\nnearly three quarters (72 percent) of Americans favored the establishment of a nationwide \\nelectronic information exchange.19 Four in five indicated that, if physicians kept electronic medical \\nrecords on their patients, health care quality would improve and medical errors would be reduced \\nbecause physicians would be able to retrieve a patient’s complete medical history in a matter of \\nseconds.20 About four in five (81 percent) also believed that EMRs would enable physicians to \\ndetermine what treatments work best for different diseases.21 Diverse Banking Models In 2000, \\nRamsaroop and Ball described the concept of the individual “banking on health,” using PHRs in the \\nsame way as one would use a personal bank or credit cards to withd raw and deposit information at \\nATMs. The PHR would give consumers worldwide access to a secure vault for storage, account \\nupdates, and services.22,23 Ramsaroop and Ball suggested that the e -commerce model then \\nevolving in  banking “provides multiple appli cations for both consumers and institutions and lays the \\ngroundwork for the formation of alliances with providers of other types of services, such as \\nhealthcare.”24 Significantly, they noted that PHRs “would not replace the physician’s or the \\ninstitution’s  records; rather, they would function as personal records that consumers could control \\nand share, all or in part, with whom they choose, and when, where, and how they choose.”25 Their \\nBank -of-Health concept went beyond “static information consolidation” to  support a wide array of \\nconsumer services, such as “electronic verification of immunizations and physical exam summary \\ninformation,” within “a highly sophisticated network” potentially capable of providing consumers \\nwith a “one -stop -shopping” business mod el.26 Three more recent models for health record banking \\nexemplify the diversity of thought regarding the use of banking systems for assembling and \\nprotecting the personal health record. These include Shabo’s non -centric Independent Health \\nRecords Bank, Ya snoff’s eHealthTrust, and Gold’s Health Record Bank. Shabo presents a non -centric \\nIndependent Health Records Bank system, one in which lifelong medical records are deposited and \\nmaintained in independent repositories mandated through legislation.27 The key  to Shabo’s concept \\nis the shift from each provider being responsible for the storage and maintenance of their portion of \\nthe healthcare consumer’s records to an IHRB that will be legally responsible to gather and \\nwarehouse all providers’ records, as shown  in Figure 1. Multiple competing IHRBs will be owned \\nprivately and independently of healthcare providers, health insurers, government agencies, and \\nhealth consumers, thus avoiding conflicts of interest. Shabo’s model is neither “government -\\ncentric,” becaus e it does not focus on national repositories for citizen EHRs, nor “provider -centric,” \\nbecause provider records are forwarded to external custody, nor “consumer -centric,” because \\npatients do not own or maintain copies of their own records. This model conce ntrates on the \\n“objective and independent service of sustaining individual EHRs, much like financial banks are \\nperceived with regard to certain financial assets.”28 It also solves the need for a nationwide  unique \\npatient identifier, which poses privacy c oncerns in countries such as the United States. eHealthTrust, \\nYasnoff’s proposed central repository for patient information, will be paid for and controlled by the \\nconsumer, as shown in Figure 2. Financial incentives, paid for by the consumer, will reimbur se the \\nprovider for the use of a standard electronic record for each patient encounter. Because HIPAA regulations require holders of patient data to make this information available to the consumer upon \\nrequest, the additional financial motivation given the  physician will help make this system \\nsustainable. Patient access and control of the data remain key elements to this model, as does \\nphysician incentives to utilize an electronic health record and comply with use of a standard form.29 \\nIn contrast with the previous models, Gold envisions a Health Record Bank that will enable the \\nconsumer to store all personal health information in a secure virtual “account,” or PHR, and possibly, \\nsimilar to a financial bank, could pay its owner a dividend for this with appro priate permissions from \\nall concerned.30 As shown in Figure 3, the HRB will include information from a wide range of \\nhealthcare sources, along with that added by the consumer, such as treatment directives and living \\nwills. These records, or PHRs, will be o wned and controlled by the consumer, who will direct who \\nhas access to which parts of the record over what period of time, and who can deposit information \\nin the record. With the consumer’s permission, the HRB can lease access to de -identified data in \\ndata banks for use by pharmaceutical and medical technology companies, insurance companies, \\nresearch institutions, universities, and government agencies. Through its Bank Association Data \\nExchange, possibly a division of a RHIO, a consumer’s leased de -identifie d health data could be \\nreleased according to prearranged agreements to provide a dividend to its owner. Legislation, \\nsimilar to that governing financial banking institutions, will define consumer and bank  controls, \\nestablish regulatory committees, and pr otect the consumer against loss, as the Federal Deposit \\nInsurance Corporation does for financial accounts. These models propose systems in which \\nindividual consumers place their health information in a bank that is part of a larger networked \\nsystem. Critic al issues common to all health record bank models are the standardization of data \\nentry and sharing interoperability, stakeholder acceptance, medico -legal definitions and legal \\nmandate, information security, HIPAA standards for privacy and confidentiality,  accountability and \\nauditability, business incentives and considerations, and operating speeds. Thus, these concepts \\nmap to the PHRs and regional health information organizations that we are focusing on. PHR \\nDefinitions In Connecting Americans to Their Hea lthcare, the Markle Foundation defines the PHR as \\n“an electronic application through which individuals can access, manage and share, their health \\ninformation in a secure and confidential environment. It allows people to access and coordinate \\ntheir lifelong  health information and make appropriate parts of it available to those who need it.”31 \\nThus, it differs from the EHR, which is “an electronic version of the patient medical record kept by \\nphysicians and hospitals. The data in the EHR are controlled by and  intended for use by medical \\nproviders.”32 Another attempt at definition, by HIMSS Analytics, uses the older term, EMR, to refer \\nto the legal record owned and used by the healthcare facility to document and manage encounters, \\nrefers to the record shared ac ross institutions as the EHR and makes no mention of the PHR as \\nsuch.33 During the transition to a national health information network, it may be helpful to define \\nthree interdependent entities. Within this construct, the EMR is the basic building block, t he source \\nof information that feeds the EHR; the EHR is the longitudinal record made possible by RHIOs and \\ninteroperability across care delivery organizations; and the PHR is the record owned, accessed, and \\nmanaged by the consumer. The interdependencies ar e clear. Without linkages to the EMR, the PHR \\ndepends on the consumer to manually input vital data, like laboratory results. Without an EHR, the \\nPHR cannot accept information from multiple providers. In short, the PHR belongs in the domain of \\nthe individua l, while the EHR is in the domain of the provider. The EMR is the legal health record in \\nthe domain of the provider. It is important to note that, as a standalone accounting of personal \\nhealth information, the PHR has limited value; as an interactive accou nt with the healthcare system \\nas a whole, it offers a wide array of benefits. Ultimately, the PHR and the environment that supports \\nit can transform healthcare to the patient -centered model advocated by the Institute of Medicine. \\nThe PHR is further defined  by the information it contains, something that discussions of the \\nelectronically enabled PHR, the focus of this paper, do not generally address. The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) characterizes the PHR as “a collection of impor tant \\ninformation about your health or the health of someone you’re caring for, such as a parent or a \\nchild, that  you actively maintain and update.”34 AHIMA details what that information should \\ninclude, regardless of the record’s medium, as shown in Table  1.35 The 2003 report of the Markle \\nFoundation’s Personal Health Working Group identified attributes common to the different forms of \\nthe PHR. In short, the PHR is a lifelong and comprehensive record, controlled by the individual, \\naccessible anywhere and a nytime; private and secure, it facilitates information exchange across the \\nhealthcare system; transparent, it enables the individual owner to see who has entered and viewed \\ndata.36 The report defined the PHR as an enabler that “connects each of us to the i ncredible \\npotential of modern healthcare” while it “gives us control over our own information.” According to \\nthe report, the PHR provides an integrated and comprehensive view of information, “self -generated \\nas well as from physicians, pharmacies, and insur ance companies,” and serves as a communications \\nhub that can be used to e -mail physicians, transfer information to specialists, receive test results, \\nand access educational and decision support tools.37 In 2005, the Markle Foundation’s 44 -member \\nPersonal H ealth Technology Council, including “leading consumer and privacy advocates, medical \\nprofessionals, informatics experts, payers, technologists, federal policymakers, bioethicists, and \\nresearchers,” endorsed seven patient and consumer principles. Framed to guide the development of \\nelectronic information exchange in the public and private sectors, these principles reflect critical \\nissues associated with the evolution and acceptance of interoperable PHRs.38 Principle 1. \\n“Individuals should be able to access th eir health and medical data conveniently and affordably.” As \\nto access, the report, “Consumers in Health Care: The Burden of Choice” documents that American \\nconsumers want to be more involved in their healthcare. Nine out of 10 want to be an active and \\ninvolved partner with their physician (Hart Research 2004). More than half (52 percent) want to \\nmake final treatment decisions for themselves or a family member, and 38 percent want to make \\nthose decisions together with their physician (Rand 2005).39 Convenie nce and affordability are \\nother matters. Studies cited in The Burden of Choice document notable differences related to age, \\ngender, education, economic status, and ethnicity.40 Older Americans are less likely to go online \\n(Kaiser 2004), as are households w ith lower incomes, lower educational levels, and less Internet \\nexperience (Pew 2005). Principle 2. “Individuals should be able to authorize when and with whom \\ntheir health data is shared. Individuals should be able to refuse to make their health data avail able \\nfor sharing by opting out of nationwide information exchange.” Six out of 10 (59 percent) consumers \\nview their PHRs as information they can choose to share in exchange for some benefits (such as \\naccess to care or discounts); around half (53 percent) r egard their PHRs as information they own and \\nhave a duty to share to advance healthcare or as information they own and control (49 percent).41 \\nEnabling individuals to opt out of nationwide information exchange addresses opposition to a \\nmandatory,  providi ng telehealth capabilities, with six major hospitals serving as hubs and \\nstakeholders planning for electronic health data exchange. • PeaceHealth, an integrated delivery \\nnetwork in the Pacific Northwest, serving Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, offering tec hnology \\nservices and access to a comprehensive community health record. As its first case study, the white \\npaper1 presents HealthBridge as an example of collaboration, not boundaries. Launched in the mid -\\n1990s by large employers in the area in an attempt t o control costs, HealthBridge is an independent \\nnot-for-profit corporation, with providers and payers represented on the governing board. Founded \\nwith seed money from stakeholders, it was intended to sustain itself from revenues. Results delivery \\nservice n ow funds all of its projects, and provider organizations save money by participating. For \\nexample, St. Elizabeth Medical Center estimates that having HealthBridge deliver diagnostic test \\nresults saves $500,000 per year and reduces phone calls for results b y 40 percent. HealthBridge \\noffers a single standard community interface; more than 50 clinical applications are available on its \\npassword -protected portal, which currently runs at around 46,000 information requests per month from approximately 4,000 active  physicians. As its second case study, the white paper described \\nPeaceHealth as “managing the health of an entire community.” Launched in the early 1990s to \\nconnect six community hospitals, outpatient medical groups, regional laboratories, and pharmacies, \\nthis not -for-profit corporation serves medium -sized and rural communities. PeaceHealth serves the \\n340 physicians employed at its ambulatory clinics and 1,700 independent physicians through a \\ncommunity health record used in both inpatient and outpatient set tings. Since 1996, when the CHR \\nwent live, PeaceHealth has collected records for 1.5 million individuals, creating a data warehouse \\nthat populates data marts focused on chronic diseases that can be searched in a matter of seconds. \\nThis capability was used in 2004, when Vioxx was recalled, to identify patients who had been \\nprescribed the drug. The third study looks at CalRHIO’s efforts toward “building a business model for \\nhealth information exchange” in the nation’s most populous state. Fewer than 10 percen t of the \\nstate’s physicians and 25 percent of its hospitals have functioning EMRs. Begun as a project of the \\nHealth Technology Center in January 2005 and slated to become an independent not -for-profit in \\nJanuary 2006, CalRHIO first inventoried health infor mation exchange projects in the state and now is \\ndeveloping a list of recommended standards for providers. Providers, payers and other stakeholders \\nfrom more than 60 health -related organizations are involved in CalRHIO working groups. Based on \\nstakeholder input, CalRHIO has selected five projects: emergency department linking, infrastructure, \\nadministrative efficiencies, medication management, and personal health records. It seeks to \\nprovide leadership and foster incremental change. The fourth case study re views the Indiana \\nNetwork for Patient Care and “the interface between technology and policy.” Now about a decade \\nold, it was created to serve as an operational community -wide patient record system. A joint project \\nof the Indiana Health Information Exchange  and the Regenstrief Institute, the network demonstrates \\nthe feasibility and benefits of a community -wide electronic health record system. It includes 21 \\nhospitals in five major hospital systems and serves as a referral center for the entire state. Its \\narchitecture is that of a federated consistent database; data are received primarily as HL7 messages \\nand then standardized according to rigorous requirements. The INPC database contains 7 million \\nregistration events, 48 million orders, 45 million radiology im ages with 8.8 million radiology reports, \\nand 25 million prescriptions. The system is accessed more than 3 million times a year, and peak \\nusage exceeds 10,000 hits per hour. According to an economic model developed by the Center for \\nInformation Technology L eadership, savings for central Indiana could potentially reach $560 million. \\nThe fifth model described in the white paper is the Nebraska Statewide Telehealth Network, \\nexemplifying “strong partnerships delivering a statewide health information infrastructu re.” In a \\npublic -private partnership, providers own the Telehealth Network and the state government \\nmaintains the technical infrastructure. By the end of 2005, 95 percent of its connections were live. \\nRural hospitals pay $100 a month to access videoconfere ncing. The network plans to build on this \\nculture of collaboration, possibly by using the existing network to transmit patient data, such as \\ndiagnostic test results and images, and by supporting broader adoption of EHRs. In addition, the \\nprogram SimplyWell , a combination of PHRs and disease prevention developed at the Nebraska \\nMedical Center, makes patients “their own health manager.” Based on claims reductions so far, \\nSimplyWell could potentially reduce costs by 20 percent. These five case studies describe  exemplars \\nof solutions to barriers in the areas of financing, health management, privacy and security, technical \\ninfrastructure, and cultural change. PHR Working Models Like RHIOs, PHRs come in a multitude of \\nforms and are developed by different entities with different philosophies to meet different needs. \\nThese differences are reflected in their PHRs, which are working models that are in place today. For \\nthese reasons, they do not fully reflect the health record banking models set forth by Shabo, Yasnoff,  \\nand Gold, which are conceptually dependent upon the capabilities provided by RHIOs. One PHR \\nmodel is that of the Veterans Health  Administration’s MyHealtheVet. Its power was demonstrated in \\nthe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when physicians and patient s throughout southeast Louisiana, Mississippi, and the Florida panhandle struggled without access to paper patient records, and more \\nthan the 38,000 veterans and their physicians did not.55 VA physicians and patients had “access to \\ninformation those outsid e the VA are dreaming of: up to 20 years of lab results and six years’ worth \\nof X-rays, scans, physicians’ notes, and medication records.”56 After logging in at the VA’s portal, \\nwww.myhealthevet.va.gov, registered users have access to information in their own accounts, which \\nincludes details on benefits and services, health information, and a health assessment tool. \\nFunctions include access to a personal health journal, which includes demographics, contact \\ninformation, provider names, and more; Health eLogs  to record blood sugar, blood pressure, pain \\nlevels, and other information; and room for self -entered information such as military history and \\ndrug records for prescriptions, over -the-counter medications, and herbal preparations. Veterans can \\nuse their PHR s to arrange for prescription refills online, create a family health history, and print \\nwallet -sized identification cards. In late 2005, for My HealtheVet’s second anniversary, the VA \\nreleased three new health journals to help veterans monitor their health . These include a Food \\nJournal for recording daily food intake, an Activity Journal, to record daily exercise routines, and \\nPulse Oximetry to help monitor the usefulness of oxygen therapy. Help features include a virtual \\ntour, My Care, explaining important  tools and features. According to Jonathan Perlin, MD, the acting \\nundersecretary for health at the VA, MyHealtheVet “recognizes a person has interests in how his \\ncare is  managed”57 and is “available 100 percent of the time for 100 percent of the VA patie nts.”58 \\nThere are several models of PHRs in the private sector, including those put in place by healthcare \\ninstitutions to better serve their patients. One that has received significant attention is PatientSite. \\nLaunched in 2000 by CareGroup information sy stems and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, \\nPatientSite provides patients with services, education, and their own PHR. Enrollment reached \\n11,000 patients and included 120 physician users in 40 practices as of February 2003.59 Available at \\nhttp://www.pa tientsite.org, the PHR offers services, such as e -mail, prescriptions, appointments, \\nreferrals, links and account statements; records and a personal profile; and help features. When \\nregistered users sign on, they see a list of appointments, providers, and e-mail. The success of \\nPatientSite has introduced controversial and interesting issues. According to Sands and Halamka, \\nthese include, “Should patients have full electronic access to their record, or should certain types of \\ndata be restricted? Is it necess ary for physicians to review results before patients can view them? \\nShould patients be permitted to use PatientSite to view their record if their physician does not use \\nPatientSite? What happens to patient -entered information in the personal health record?  Should \\nphysicians be able to view the patient’s personal health record? Should they be required to do so?60 \\nTwo institutions in the private sector are among the early leaders in installing vendor -developed \\nPHRs. (For a partial listing of these vendors, se e Table 2.) Cleveland Clinic offers the PHR developed \\nby Epic Systems at eCleveland Clinic MyChart at https://mychart.clevelandclinic.org. Adult patients \\nof primary care physicians can review past appointments, manage prescription renewals, make or \\ncancel appointments, and access reliable health information on topics that interest them. Using the \\nPHR developed by Cerner, IQHealth, Winona Health Online offers “consumer patients” who register \\na personal health profile, health assessment, online prescription r efills, drug information, and the \\nability to receive lab and test results through secure messaging. According to \\nwww.winonahealth.org, “This free service allows you to actively manage your own health and the \\nhealth of your loved ones,” and it is “a secure site…safer than online banking or as safe as using your \\nATM card.” Another PHR model is payer -based, not institution -based, made available to employees \\non their employer’s or health plan’s Web site. A major force in the commercial sector, WebMD’s \\nPHR also attracts unique visitors to www.webmed.com every month, promising even greater PHR \\naccess.61 The current version of WebMD’s PHR offers services, including personalized health and \\nbenefit information, benefit and treatment decision support, and targeted cli nical messages. It \\nintegrates self -reported and professional data, including medical and medication claims, to create a complete profile of health history and health status. Corporations now offering WebMD’s PHR to \\ntheir employees include IBM, Verizon, Int el, Pepsi -Co, and Ford62 among many others. The extent of \\nactivity within the healthcare industry is reflected by the number of PHR vendors. In November \\n2005, HIMSS Executive Vice President Carla Smith offered a list of more than 30 PHRs currently \\navailabl e, as a snapshot in time, with the caveat that the list is incomplete (see Table 2).63 Clarifying \\nthe Vision Work being done under NHIN contract is expected to clarify how the PHR will evolve and \\noperate. At this time, use cases are being developed in bios urveillance, the electronic health record, \\nand consumer empowerment, identified in 2005 as “breakthrough areas” by the Health and Human \\nServices’ American Health Information Community. Currently, the Office of the National \\nCoordinator, David Brailer, MD, P hD, is completing the “harmonization” of input from the four NHIN \\nconsortia —IBM, Accenture, CSC, and Northrup Grumman —and three other working groups \\nrepresenting clinicians and clinical practices. The use cases addressing consumer empowerment will \\nguide ef forts to involve consumers in actively managing their own healthcare. Focused on the short \\nterm, these will set forth first steps and lay the framework for gaining wide adoption of consumer -\\ncentric PHRs that are easy to use, portable, longitudinal, and aff ordable. This framework will specify \\npolicies and mechanisms involved in such areas as consumer and physician access and business \\nfunctionalities. It also will identify obstacles and necessary conditions. A Time for Transformation \\nThe vignettes in the new report, Ending the Document Game, highlight the experiences of patients \\ncoping with chronic conditions and terminal diagnoses, along with statements from physicians, \\ndentists, pharmacists, and nurses. All point to the need for transformation. As the Commis sion on \\nSystemic Interoperability drives home in Ending the Document Game: Connecting and Transforming \\nYour Healthcare Through Information Technology, “There is no single step that, if taken, would \\ncreate a connected nationwide system of health information .”64 Rather, there are multiple steps, \\nwhich the commission, a federal health information technology initiative, organizes into three \\ncategories: adoption, interoperability, and connectivity. PHRs and other extensive transformational \\nchanges, like the use of health record banks and RHIOs, have multiple success factors. These include \\nthe establishment of a NHIN, re -education of the public, attention to the security and privacy of \\nhealth information, the willingness to change the  way practitioners work in h ealthcare, and still \\nothers not touched upon here. Change is not an easy task, but the use of models, like those \\nsummarized in this article, can help facilitate the process. Adoption requires public awareness. For \\nthe healthcare technology and informatics community, this means making the benefits of networked \\ninteroperable PHRs apparent to consumers and clinicians. Consumers are concerned about the \\nhealthcare that they and their families need, not about technical features. Clinicians are focused on \\ndeliveri ng care, not on acquiring or using electronic record systems, which are in place in only 15 \\npercent to 20 percent of physicians’ offices65 and in only 20 percent to 25 percent of hospitals in the \\nU.S.66 Consumers using PHRs in an environment supported by R HIOs will bring “high expectations to \\nhealthcare relationships. These expectations can improve the way the system interacts with the \\npatient and the way care is delivered.”67 As Ball and Costin state in their contribution to the 2006 \\nHIMSS proceedings, “As  a standalone accounting of personal health information, the PHR has little \\nvalue; as an interactive account with the healthcare system as a whole, it offers a wide array of \\nbenefits.”68 Just as personal ATMs derive their utility from their interface with the world of banking \\nand financial services, so too will PHRs realize their potential when they are part of a health \\ninformation network that spans the whole of healthcare. Only then will healthcare become truly \\npatient -centered. About the Authors A member  of the Institute of Medicine, Marion J. Ball, EdD, \\nFHIMSS, CHIME, serves on the HIMSS board.

The study used a dataset consisting of 57 institutions to examine the correlation between the \\ncapital structure and financial performance of banks. The panel regression models were employed \\nover the time frame of 2000 –2022, utilising  both fixed effect and random effect models. Return on \\nequity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) are the two metrics used for evaluating financial \\nperformance. The results of this study indicate that the debt -to-equity ratio, net profit margin, and \\nsize show  statistical relevance. Due to their large size and high debt -to-equity ratio, public sector \\nbanks have performed worse than private and foreign sector banks in terms of these factors. Banks \\nface significant difficulty with regards to their low financial p erformance, mostly due to factors such \\nas the debt -to-equity ratio and return on capital used. The data suggests that the capital structure \\nhas had a considerable impact on the financial performance of the Indian banking sector, particularly \\nin recent year s. The empirical analysis also shows that there is no statistically significant correlation \\nbetween net interest margin, current ratio, and the metrics of return on assets and return on equity \\nfor Indian banks.  \\n1. Introduction Banks follow international standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking \\nSupervision to manage their capital composition. Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III are three \\nregulatory frameworks for banking supervision that have standardized capital regulation \\nglobally. The bank buffer th eory suggests that banks maintain capital reserves exceeding \\nregulatory requirements. In response to the 2008 financial crisis, India introduced regulatory \\nreforms to ensure sufficient capital for banks. Central banks should consider the impact of \\npolicy r ates on the capital structure and stability of banks when responding to economic \\nshocks. Capital structure is a financial strategy that includes reserves, surpluses, and long -\\nterm sources of finance such as debentures, long -term debts, preference shares, a nd \\nordinary share capital. Effectively managing the debt -to-equity ratio is crucial for a bank's \\nstability and financial health. Debt and equity serve distinct functions within a capital \\nsystem, with debt being advantageous for businesses due to tax benefi ts and equity allowing \\nexternal investors to obtain stakes in the business. Identifying an ideal capital structure for a \\nbank depends on factors such as industry categorization, growth potential, and risk \\ntolerance. Financial performance assessment involve s using indicators like return on assets \\n(ROA), return on equity (ROE), and net profit margin (NPM). Banks' capital structure can \\ninfluence their clients' characteristics, as consumers with varying levels of dependence on \\nliquidity and credit may be attrac ted to different types of banks.  \\n2. Theoretical framework Two perspectives on capital structure in the banking sector have \\nbeen explored. One suggests that higher capital enhances banks' incentive to choose asset \\nportfolios efficiently and monitor borrowers, leading to more lending, liquidity creation, and \\nhigher  bank values. The other suggests that higher AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL \\nSTRUCTURE DYNAMICS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN THE INDIAN BANKING SECTOR \\n111 capital may reduce liquidity or transaction costs, resulting in lower liquidity creation by \\nbanks. B oth studies agree that higher capital in the banking sector reduces systemic risk and \\nfragility. However, the Indian banking sector has a unique feature where one bank's failure \\ncan trigger failures in other banks, as an individual bank's problem informs t he potential \\nproblems of other banks. This has been evident from the 2006 -08 period leading up to the \\n2008 financial crisis. Empirical evidence suggests that commercial banks with higher capital \\nhave a better capability of surviving a financial crisis, and  small banks with higher capital are \\nmore likely to survive in normal times. 2.1 Capital structure and financial stability. Bank \\ncapital plays a crucial role in bank management, survival, market share, and regulatory concerns. Bank regulators prioritize ba nk survival and market share as they impact the \\nstability of the financial system. They assess the impact of bank capital on performance \\nduring normal times and during financial crises, assessing whether higher capital levels \\nsignificantly affect a bank's survival likelihood and varying based on factors like bank size and \\ncrisis nature. Capital structure, which includes debt and equity financing, is essential for a \\nfinancial institution's stability. A well -balanced capital structure can provide a buffer aga inst \\neconomic downturns and unexpected losses. A higher proportion of equity can enhance a \\nbank's resilience during financial stress, while a heavy reliance on debt may increase \\nvulnerability, especially if the debt is short -term or low -quality. However, t he odds support \\nthe hypothesis that capital increases the likelihood of survival, as supported by reviews in \\nFreixas and Rochet (2008). 2.2 Choice of capital structure A bank can choose to use a \\ncombination of preferred capital, debt, or equity sources for  its investment. Factors such as \\nindustry type, earnings consistency, money market makeup, and investor sentiment \\ninfluence the selection of an acceptable capital structure. Debt capital is a liability that the \\nbank must pay interest regardless of its prof it, while equity capital is made up of owners' or \\nshareholders' funds, with the obligation to pay dividends dependent on its profit margin. \\nVarious theories suggest that higher capital levels increase a bank's likelihood of survival. \\nThese theories argue t hat capital reduces the appeal of risky products, mitigates moral \\nhazards, and enhances a bank's incentive to monitor borrowers, reducing default \\nprobabilities. However, some theories argue that increasing capital might encourage banks \\nto take on more risk . Empirical research generally supports the idea that higher capital \\nimproves a bank's competitive position in asset and liability markets, increasing its chances \\nof survival. Banks with larger capital bases are often more successful in competing for \\ndepos its and loans. Recent banking theories suggest a positive relationship between capital \\nand market share, and banks with larger capital can compete more effectively for market \\nshare. The decision about capital structure policy is between projected return an d risk, with \\nthe optimal capital structure striking a balance between these risks and returns by \\nexamining the stock price. The relationship between capital structure and financial stability \\nis multifaceted and may vary across institutions. Factors such as  asset quality, risk \\nmanagement practices, and market conditions play a role in determining the impact of \\ncapital structure on stability. 3. Review of literature 3.1 Theoretical Review Some of the \\nstudies that highlight the significance of the capital stru cture and its relation to the financial \\nperformance of the banking sector are as follows: Trade -off theory and pecking order theory \\nassert the presence of a linkage between leverage and performance, and their propositions \\nare empirically testable. The trad e-off theory contends that a firm's creation of an ideal \\ncapital structure can increase firm value. The trade -off theory was initially developed out of \\nthe argument over the Modigliani and Miller theories. The trade -off theory argues that \\norganisations cou ld enhance their value by trading off the benefits and costs of borrowing. \\nThe benefit of debt is thought to be the tax shield of debt, which can enhance firm value \\nthrough debt issuance (Myers 1984). Moreover, Modigliani and Miller (1963) emphasize that \\ntax savings are the key benefit of debt, which assists firms in reducing their total taxable \\nincome through interest payments. Thus, empirical evidence supports the hypotheses of \\ntrade -off and pecking order theories.  \\nThe trade -off theory and pecking order  theory can also explicate the logic of the reverse causal \\nassociation between performance and leverage with empirical evidence. The trade -off theory \\nexpects a positive effect of profitability on leverage. It is argued that the possibility of bankruptcy \\nmoves in reverse with profitability (Fama & French, 2002). Iavorskyi (2013) examined the impact of capital structure (debt -to-assets ratio) on the performance (return on assets, return on sales, and \\ntotal factor productivity) of 16,500 Ukrainian firms betwee n 2001 and 2010. The results state that a \\nnegative relationship exists between leverage and performance in Ukraine. Firms with high future \\ngrowth opportunities should use more equity in their financing because higher leverage is likely to \\nencourage more pr ofitable investment opportunities. According to Titman & Wessels (1988) and \\nHuang & Song (2002), factors that affect capital structure include a firm's size, asset structure, \\nprofitability, growth prospects, and tax rates. Furthermore, highly profitable fi rms have a greater \\ntendency to bear more debt, aiming to benefit from tax savings (Frank and Goyal, 2009). \\nWiwattanakantang (1999) adds that firms with high cash flow shall obtain debts more easily \\ncompared to low profitable firms. Therefore, bankruptcy co sts and agency costs imply that high \\nprofitability is related to a higher debt ratio. In other words, firm performance can positively impact \\nthe capital structure. The results of previous empirical studies could support the proposition of the \\ntrade -off the ory (Adedeji, 2002; Salawu and Agboola, 2008). Whereas the pecking order theory \\nargues that highly profitable companies more potentially depend on the earned surplus to finance \\ntheir assets, not external sources (Ghosh and Cai, 1999; Myers, 1984), Conseque ntly, the effect of \\nprofitability on leverage is presupposed to be negative, holding the investment level stable (Tong \\nand Green, 2005). Empirically, several studies have observed a negative association between the \\nratios of debt and profitability (Viviani , 2008; Yolanda and Soekarno, 2012; Guner, 2016; Jarallah et \\nal., 2019; Moradi and Paulet, 2019). These theories are financial principles that help a financial firm \\nchoose its capital structure. Each one of them plays a vital role in the decision -making pr ocess reliant \\non the type of capital structure that the firm wants to achieve in a particular period. However, the \\npecking order theory has been empirically observed to be the most used approach in determining a \\nfirm's capital structure. There are several other ways that firms can decide on the ideal capital \\nstructure, like cash in from sales, stock sold to investors, and debt sold to bondholders. Accurate \\nanalysis of the capital structure can help a company by optimizing the cost of capital and improving \\nprofitability. With all these literary theories, it seems that these types of hypotheses are mutually \\nexclusive, and it is quite challenging to draw a firm conclusion from them. However, it helps create a \\nshared understanding of the significance of bank cap ital and bank monitoring incentives. Each of \\nthese hypothesis’s states that when bank failure rises (decline probability), the value of banking \\nservices decreases. However, high leverage may jeopardize the provision of liquidity if banks are \\nunable to elim inate asset risks. 3.2 Empirical Review The relationship between capital structure and \\nprofitability in the US banking industry was analysed with the GMM approach to control \\nendogeneity and heterogeneity issues. The findings showed a non monotonic connecti on and a \\nstrong negative relationship between these factors, following the agency theory (Hoffmann, P.S. \\n2010). The relationship between financial leverage and overall financial performance in the fuel and \\nenergy sector of Pakistan showed a positive relati onship between financial leverage and overall \\nperformance (Akhtar, S., Javed, B., Maryam, A., & Sadia, H. 2012). The relationship between the \\ndebt -to-equity ratio and the capital structure of commercial banks in Nigeria was also examined. The \\nresults of th is study showed a positive and large effect on return on equity with no unidirectional or \\nbidirectional relationship between the capital structure and the performance of commercial banks \\n(Nwude, E.C., & Anyalechi, K.C. 2018). Empirically, several studies h ave observed a positive \\nassociation between the capital structure and financial performance of banking firms (Abdullah, H., \\n& Tursoy, T., 2021; Dai, T. B., 2017). Sofi, T. R., et. al., (2023) examined the financial performance of \\n14 Indian public sector ba nks from 2000 to 2020, focusing on profitability, liquidity, and asset \\nquality. Results show that debt equity ratio and return on assets positively impact net profit margin \\nand return on equity. However, banks face financial losses due to interest expenses  and debt \\nrepayments. Despite this, profitability is increasing due to overall debt equity ratio and size  The study suggests that banks could improve their financial system by diversifying income \\nproduction through customer -based financial services. Roberts, M. R., & Whited, T. M. (2013) talk \\nabout the problem of endogeneity in empirical corporate finance. End ogeneity is when there is a link \\nbetween the variables that explain something and the error term in a regression. This can cause \\nparameter estimates to be biassed and not match up with reality. Random effect and fixed effect \\nmodels are unable to account fo r endogeneity. Therefore, the Generalised Method of Moments \\n(GMM) is recommended to estimate and account for endogeneity. It has been argued that the GMM \\nestimator can choose parameter estimates that will reduce the association between the instrument \\nand t he disturbance term to zero (Wooldridge, 2001). Therefore, the relationship between capital \\nstructure and firm performance in various firms has been extensively studied and analysed. The use \\nof GMM models and the use of various econometric models, such as Random -Effect, Fixed -Effect, \\nand Generalised Methods of Moments, helps to understand the complex relationship between \\ncapital structure and performance in various industries. This study has thoroughly summarized both \\ntheoretical and empirical literature, w here one can understand that there are some potential \\nbenefits to having a higher debt load. Eventually, the impact of capital structure on financial \\nperformance depends on several factors. Banks need to carefully consider their circumstances \\nbefore making  decisions about their capital structure. The regulatory view of the capital structure of \\nan individual bank is that it should have sufficient capital to give to its stakeholders because \\npreventing the failure of the individual bank can lower the possibili ty of contagion. The objective of \\nthis study is to examine the impact of capital structure on the financial performance of the banking \\nsector in India for the period 2000 –2022.  \\n3.Data and Methodology The study is based on secondary data and involves emp irical estimation \\nutilising multiple econometric models. The income and financial statements of the banks from 2000 \\nto 2022 have been extracted from the INDIASTAT and Prowess (IQ) CMIE databases. Panel methods, \\nsuch as fixed effect and random effect models , have been employed in conjunction with Hausman's \\nspecification test. These econometric techniques are designed to address the problems of causative \\nfactors and the dynamics of the relationship between capital structure and the financial \\nperformance of th e banking industry in India. The analytical stage involved utilising financial ratios \\nderived from the financial accounts to determine the effect on financial performance. A total of 57 \\nbanks from the public, private, and foreign banks were chosen to serve  as the sample. This research \\nomits specific banks that had incomplete audited income statements and financial statements to \\navoid any potential prejudice.  \\ninvestment resources. NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income by total assets. Bank size  is \\nalso included as an independent variable in size -related economies and diseconomies. Total assets \\nshould be logged before being included in models, as they are related to other dependent variables \\nlike ROA. The higher the equity -to-asset ratio, the sma ller the requirement for external finance and \\ngreater profitability. Our analysis is confined to the activities of the 57 banks (including public, \\nprivate, and foreign) listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). In exploring the relationship \\nbetween capita l structure and financial performance among these banks, this study employs fixed \\neffects (FE) and random effects (RE) panel regression models, complemented by Hausman’s \\nspecification test, a pivotal step following the application of both panel data techni ques. Should the \\nresults demonstrate statistical significance in both fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models, \\nit would necessitate the rejection of the hypothesis positing a consistent absence of differences in \\ncoefficients (Dougherty, 2007).  \\nonclusion The deterioration of the debt -to-equity ratio (DER) and size have had a negative impact on \\nthe financial performance of public sector banks. In contrast, private sector and foreign sector banks have not had the same negative effects. The sole det erminant of the decline in financial \\nperformance in India is size. The dismal financial performance is mostly attributed to the DER, ROCE, \\nand SIZE aspects of banks, including public, private, and foreign banks. Even though other variables \\nlike size, curre nt ratio (CR), return on capital employed (ROCE), and net interest margin (NIM) had an \\neffect, the study did not find any significant links between return on assets (ROA) and return on \\nequity (ROE). These characteristics were determined to be statistically  insignificant, indicating that \\nthey have little impact on the financial performance of Indian banks. Its capital structure had a big \\nimpact on the bank's financial performance. The debt -to-equity ratio (DER) and the company's size \\nnegatively impacted the return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), but the net profit margin \\n(NPM) showed a substantial positive correlation with ROA and ROE. Hence, it can be inferred that \\nthe performance (profitability) of Indian banks is primarily driven by characteris tics like capital \\nstructure and net profit margin rather than interest margin, size, and current ratio. This underscores \\nthe need for effectively controlling debt levels and optimizing profit margins to enhance financial \\nperformance in the banking industry . \""
